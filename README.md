# HTTP/3   
HTTP/3 aims to significantly improve HTTP/2 in terms of performance. HTTP/3 is based on the [QUIC Transport Protocol](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-quic-transport-29), which is built atop UDP. The idea behind using UDP is to remove the [head-of-line blocking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head-of-line_blocking) phenomenon present in TCP.   
In short, HTTP/3 is a relatively straightforward adaptation of HTTP/2 running over QUIC, which actually does the heavy lifting. QUIC is a remarkable protocol in two aspects. The first one is the low-latency connection establishment, e.g. that makes connecting to a website faster.   
At SafetyCulture, we have estimated that using HTTP/3 would save **thousands of hours** in latency to our combined user base. This is the conclusions we have come to based on some micro-benchmarks over WiFi internet connections. Overall, the latency improved by 20 to 40 ms when using HTTP/3.   
Our findings are actually aligned with the outcomes of Cloudflare research while [comparing](https://blog.cloudflare.com/http-3-vs-http-2/) HTTP/2 and HTTP/3. The interesting aspect of this extensive study is that the picture is not so bright, in fact HTTP/3 can perform worse than HTTP/2 depending on the size of the payload.   
However, these studies do not take into account substantial latency improvement when migrating between mobile and WiFi networks. This improvement could have a massive impact on our users since SafetyCulture’s main product, named [iAuditor](https://safetyculture.com/iauditor/), is used in a wide variety of places with disparate quality of internet access (e.g., Ethernet, WiFi, mobile networks). We are still assessing ways to gauge those benefits for our customers.   
The second major advantage of QUIC is the connection migration and resilience to NAT rebinding. As an example, WiFi to mobile network migration is seamless, i.e. there is no need to renegotiate a connection. This is called 0-RTT.   
# gRPC over HTTP/3   
Ultimately, we are trying to run both gRPC and gRPC-Web over HTTP/3 to benefit from QUIC’s performance. gRPC-Web over HTTP/3 is an easy win since modern Web browsers do support HTTP/3, whereas gRPC over HTTP/3 will require fundamental client-side adjustments. In this article, we want to leave doors open for both protocols.   

# gRPC interview prep   
Certainly, let's dive into detailed explanations for each of the interview questions related to gRPC:   
1. **What is gRPC, and how does it differ from traditional REST APIs?**   
    - **gRPC**: gRPC stands for Google Remote Procedure Call. It's a high-performance, language-agnostic, and framework-independent RPC (Remote Procedure Call) framework developed by Google. gRPC uses Protocol Buffers (protobufs) for efficient data serialization and HTTP/2 for transport. It's designed for real-time, bidirectional communication and is known for its speed and efficiency.   
    - **Differences from REST**:   
        - **Serialization**: gRPC uses binary serialization (protobufs), while REST primarily uses text-based formats like JSON or XML.   
        - **Transport**: gRPC uses HTTP/2, which supports multiplexing and header compression, while REST usually relies on HTTP/1.1.   
        - **Strong Typing**: gRPC enforces strong typing through protobufs, reducing the risk of data format errors.   
        - **Efficiency**: gRPC is generally more efficient due to binary serialization and multiplexing.   
2. **Explain the core components of a gRPC service.**   
    The core components of a gRPC service are:   
    - **Message Types**: Defined using Protocol Buffers (protobufs), these are structured data types used for communication between clients and servers.   
    - **Service Definition**: A service is defined using a `.proto` file, specifying the RPC methods the service offers, along with the message types used as parameters and return values.   
    - **Stub (Client-side)**: The client uses a stub, which is generated from the service definition, to make remote procedure calls (RPCs) to the server. The stub abstracts the complexity of network communication.   
    - **Implementation (Server-side)**: The server implements the service interface defined in the `.proto` file. It contains the actual logic to handle RPC requests from clients.   
3. **What are Protocol Buffers (protobufs) and why are they used in gRPC?**   
    - **Protocol Buffers (protobufs)**: Protocol Buffers is a method developed by Google for serializing structured data. It's language-agnostic and allows efficient binary serialization of data, making it smaller and faster to transmit than other formats like XML or JSON.   
    - **Usage in gRPC**: Protocol Buffers are used in gRPC to define the message formats for RPC method parameters and return values. They provide a standardized and efficient way to encode and decode data, ensuring consistency across different programming languages.   
4. **Describe the advantages and disadvantages of using gRPC over other communication protocols like HTTP/REST.**   
    - **Advantages**:   
        - **Efficiency**: gRPC uses binary serialization and HTTP/2, making it more efficient in terms of payload size and network usage.   
        - **Strong Typing**: Protobufs enforce strong typing, reducing the risk of data format errors.   
        - **Multiplexing**: HTTP/2 enables multiplexing multiple requests over a single connection, reducing latency.   
        - **Streaming**: gRPC supports bidirectional streaming, ideal for real-time applications.   
    - **Disadvantages**:   
        - **Complexity**: gRPC can be more complex to set up and understand compared to REST for developers not familiar with it.   
        - **Compatibility**: It might not be suitable for integrating with legacy systems or non-binary data formats.   
5. **How does gRPC handle data serialization and deserialization?**   
    gRPC uses Protocol Buffers (protobufs) for data serialization and deserialization. Here's how it works:   
    - The data to be sent is defined using protobuf messages.   
    - gRPC serializes this data into a binary format on the sender's side.   
    - The serialized data is transmitted over the network.   
    - On the receiver's side, gRPC deserializes the binary data back into protobuf messages.   
    - The receiver can then work with the deserialized data as if it were native objects.   
6. **What are the different types of RPC (Remote Procedure Call) methods provided by gRPC?**   
    gRPC provides four types of RPC methods:   
    - **Unary**: A single request from the client and a single response from the server.   
    - **Server Streaming**: A single request from the client and multiple responses from the server.   
    - **Client Streaming**: Multiple requests from the client and a single response from the server.   
    - **Bidirectional Streaming**: Multiple requests from both the client and the server, resulting in multiple responses.   
7. **Explain the concept of Unary, Server Streaming, Client Streaming, and Bidirectional Streaming RPCs. Provide use cases for each.**   
    - **Unary RPC**: Ideal for simple client-server interactions, such as sending a request to a server and receiving a response. Use cases include authentication and database queries.   
    - **Server Streaming RPC**: Suitable when the server needs to send a sequence of messages to the client in response to a single request. Examples include live updates and data feeds.   
    - **Client Streaming RPC**: Appropriate when the client needs to send a sequence of messages to the server, which responds with a single message. Use cases involve uploading data or sending logs.   
    - **Bidirectional Streaming RPC**: Used when both the client and server need to send a stream of messages independently. Common scenarios include chat applications and real-time collaboration.   
8. **What is HTTP/2, and how does it contribute to the performance of gRPC?**   
    - **HTTP/2**: HTTP/2 is a network protocol that improves upon HTTP/1.1. It introduces features like multiplexing (sending multiple requests and responses on a single connection), header compression, and prioritization.   
    - **Performance Contribution to gRPC**: gRPC uses HTTP/2 as its underlying transport. Multiplexing reduces latency by allowing multiple requests to be sent concurrently over a single connection. Header compression reduces overhead, making gRPC more efficient in terms of network usage and response times.   
9. **Discuss the security mechanisms provided by gRPC for securing communication.**   
    - **Transport Security**: gRPC supports Transport Layer Security (TLS/SSL) for encrypting data during transmission, ensuring data integrity and confidentiality.   
    - **Authentication**: gRPC allows authentication using mechanisms like OAuth, JWT (JSON Web Tokens), and custom authentication methods.   
    - **Authorization**: Authorization can be enforced by interceptors based on user roles or permissions, allowing fine-grained access control.   
10. **Explain the concept of Deadlines and Timeouts in gRPC and why they are important.**   
    - **Deadlines**: Deadlines are set by clients to specify how long they are willing to wait for an RPC to complete. They ensure that an RPC doesn't hang indefinitely, preventing resource wastage.   
    - **Timeouts**: Timeouts are a specific duration within which an RPC should complete. If an RPC exceeds its timeout, it is considered unsuccessful. Timeouts are crucial for responsive services and resource management.   
11. **How does gRPC handle errors and status codes?**   
    - gRPC uses status codes to convey the result of an RPC. Status codes include information about the success or failure of the RPC and, if it failed, details about the error. This allows clients to understand and handle errors gracefully.   
12. **What is Interceptors in gRPC, and how can they be used?**   
    - Interceptors are middleware functions that can be applied to gRPC client and server channels. They allow you to add cross-cutting concerns such as logging, authentication, and monitoring to the RPC pipeline. Interceptors can intercept and process RPC calls before they reach the actual service implementation.   
13. **How would you handle versioning of gRPC APIs?**   
    - gRPC recommends using semantic versioning for APIs. When evolving an API, maintain backward compatibility by adding fields to existing message types and avoiding breaking changes. Consider using custom options or comments to document versioning changes.   
14. **Discuss load balancing and service discovery in the context of gRPC.**   
    - Load Balancing: gRPC supports client-side load balancing, where clients can distribute requests among multiple backend servers. This ensures even distribution of traffic and fault tolerance.   
    - Service Discovery: Service discovery tools like etcd or Consul can be used to discover available gRPC services dynamically, making it easier to locate services in a distributed environment.   
15. **Explain the concept of Cancellation in gRPC and how it helps in managing client-server interactions.**   
    - Cancellation allows clients to cancel an ongoing RPC request if it's no longer needed. This prevents unnecessary work on the server and network resources from being tied up. Clients can initiate cancellation at any time, which is especially useful for long-running RPCs.   
16. **What are the best practices for designing gRPC services?**   
    - Define clear service boundaries and avoid excessive coupling.   
    - Keep message sizes small to reduce latency.   
    - Use semantic versioning for APIs.   
    - Plan for backward compatibility when evolving APIs.   
    - Implement proper authentication and authorization.   
    - Monitor and log RPC calls for debugging and performance analysis.   
17. **Give an overview of the different programming languages that support gRPC.**   
    - gRPC is supported in various languages, including Python, Java, C++, Go, JavaScript, Ruby, and more. It provides language-specific libraries and code generation tools to make gRPC easy to use in these languages.   
18. **Describe scenarios where you would choose gRPC over other communication technologies.**   
    - Choose gRPC for scenarios requiring high performance, real-time communication, strong typing, and efficient binary serialization. Examples include microservices, IoT applications, and gaming platforms.   
19. **Provide an example of how you would implement a simple gRPC chat application.**   
    - A simple gRPC chat application could involve defining message types for chat messages, creating RPC methods for sending and receiving messages, and using bidirectional streaming for real-time chat between clients and a server. This would allow users to send and receive messages in real time.   
   
## Binary Serialization   
**Binary serialization** is a method of converting structured data, such as objects or data structures, into a binary format that can be easily transmitted or stored, and then converting it back to its original form when needed. This binary representation is typically more compact and efficient for storage and transmission compared to human-readable formats like JSON or XML.   
Here are key characteristics of binary serialization:   
1. **Compactness**: Binary serialization aims to represent data using the fewest number of bytes possible. This results in smaller data payloads, which are especially beneficial in scenarios where bandwidth or storage is limited.   
2. **Efficiency**: The binary format is optimized for efficient encoding and decoding. It minimizes redundant information and includes mechanisms for encoding complex data structures efficiently.   
3. **Type Safety**: Binary serialization often enforces strong typing, ensuring that data is correctly interpreted when deserialized. This reduces the risk of type-related errors.   
4. **Performance**: Because binary serialization is more efficient and compact, it can lead to faster data transmission and processing, making it suitable for performance-critical applications.   
5. **Binary Compatibility**: Binary data formats can provide better backward and forward compatibility, as changes to the data structure can be managed without breaking existing data consumers.   
6. **Language-Agnostic**: Many binary serialization formats are designed to be language-agnostic, allowing data to be serialized in one programming language and deserialized in another.   
7. **Examples**: Common binary serialization formats include Protocol Buffers (protobufs), MessagePack, BSON (Binary JSON), and Avro.   
   
Protocol Buffers (protobufs), for example, are a widely used binary serialization format. They define a schema for structured data and provide tools to automatically generate code for serializing and deserializing data in various programming languages.   
Overall, binary serialization is favored in scenarios where data efficiency, performance, and type safety are critical, such as in network protocols, high-throughput data processing, and storage systems. It's especially valuable when transmitting data over networks with limited bandwidth or when optimizing the storage of large datasets.
